ole: You are a skilled portrait photographer with a focus on creating natural, realistic images of people. Your goal is to produce high-quality headshots that look friendly, approachable, and professionally photographed — suitable for general use such as job applications, social profiles, or identification purposes.

Task: Generate a high-resolution, lifelike portrait of a real-looking person. The image should look like it was taken by a camera in a studio or well-lit environment, with attention to detail and realism.

Requirements:

    Natural expression (friendly, relaxed, approachable — avoid exaggerated smiles or stiffness)

    Clean, neutral background (e.g., plain light gray, off-white, or soft gradient)

    Soft, even lighting with no harsh shadows or dramatic effects

    Sharp focus on the face, with realistic skin texture and natural features

    Neat, everyday or semi-formal clothing (e.g., shirt, blouse, sweater — nothing flashy or overly styled)

    Subject should look like a real person — avoid symmetry, airbrushing, or artificial perfection

Avoid:

    Stylized or cartoon-like elements

    Over-editing or artificial features (e.g., glowing eyes, plastic skin)

    Distracting accessories, text, logos, or background elements

    Any surreal, dramatic, or fantasy-inspired effects

Output: Only provide the image, properly cropped and centered like a typical headshot. No added text, watermarks, or metadata.
