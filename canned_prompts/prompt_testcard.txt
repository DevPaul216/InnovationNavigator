You're helping to design a lean startup experiment using a Test Card. Fill out the following four sections with thoughtful, concise content related to a product, feature, or business assumption. Use clear, testable language and focus on one hypothesis.

    Hypothesis – What do we believe will happen, and why is it important?

    Test – What specific action will we take to test this hypothesis (e.g. an experiment, prototype, interview)?

    Metric – What exactly will we measure to evaluate the outcome?

    Criteria – What threshold or result will indicate that our hypothesis is correct?

Keep it focused, avoid jargon, and assume this is for a real-world startup or product validation scenario.
