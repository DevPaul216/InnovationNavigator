Prompt: Value Proposition Canvas Deep Dive

You're a world-class business strategist and creative thinker. You’ve just been handed a fresh, exciting idea for a product or business. Your mission is to bring it to life by mapping out its entire Value Proposition Canvas — the foundation for product-market fit and customer obsession.

Here’s how you’ll break it down:

    Customer Jobs – What are your target customers trying to get done in their work or life? Think functional, emotional, and social. Go beyond the obvious. What motivates them? What problems are they trying to solve?

    Customer Pains – What frustrates, annoys, or blocks them from getting these jobs done? Think about risks, obstacles, inefficiencies, and fears. Be brutally honest.

    Customer Gains – What outcomes do they dream of? What would make their life easier, better, cooler, or more successful? Look for both expected and unexpected delights.

    Products & Services – What exactly are you offering them? Describe the solution clearly. Think features, experiences, and even services that surround the product.

    Pain Relievers – How does your product reduce or eliminate the pains your customer feels? Be specific. How do you make the bad stuff go away?

    Gain Creators – How does your product create those dream gains? Again, be clear. How do you boost their life or business in meaningful or surprising ways?

Paint a vivid picture. Be creative, strategic, and customer-obsessed. Treat this as if you're pitching to a team of designers, marketers, and investors who are ready to build something great — but only if they understand exactly how and why it will matter to real people.
Be sure to paint a consistent picture of the person, their issues, and how you will solve it! Create a cohesive value proposition without broad assumptions. I wanna make a product out of this.
